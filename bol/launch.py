    four figures of FPS and takes most of the GPU to display a still image
    (issue #150). vkd3d-proton's own limiter is the right place to stop that:
    it sleeps until the frame deadline instead of spinning, and it applies to
    every frame the game presents, menu included.

    Only the genuinely unpaced case is capped, and only at the refresh rate of
    the fastest display attached, so a player who set either of Minecraft's
    own limits keeps exactly what they chose and nobody loses a frame they
    could have seen. ``BOL_FRAME_RATE`` overrides both directions: 0 never
    caps, a number always caps at it. Callers pass ``environ`` with the
    Advanced custom-environment field overlaid, since that field is where
    ``BOL_FRAME_RATE`` is documented and it is applied too late in the launch
    to be visible here.

    The limit is always whole frames per second, rounded up. That is not
    cosmetic: a value carrying a decimal point is parsed as no limit at all
